Description:
	- Reads obj type of files and extract data from them. 
	- Uses the API of "ASSIMP" (https://github.com/assimp/assimp).

Types of readable data: 
	# Vertices of a 3D model
	# Normals of a 3D model
	# The program calculates the faces of the 3D model
	# Texture coordinations
	# Tangent and Bitangent
The program also reads any MTL files for:
	# Diffuse textures
	# Specular textures
	# Normal textures
	# Heightmap textures
